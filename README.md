# The Open Webtoon Format

An open-source initiative by **Komiku** to create a modern, dynamic, and accessible file format standard for webtoons and digital comics.

## A Dynamic Future for Digital Comics

The **Open Webtoon (owt) Format** reimagines the digital comic not as a static image, but as a rich, layered, and dynamic document. We envision a future where webtoons are interactive, instantly translatable, and fully accessible. By treating artwork and text as separate elements, this format empowers creators, platforms, and readers to experience content that is truly ready for the future of the web.

## The Industry's Rigid Foundation

Today, the webtoon industry is built on a simple but inflexible foundation: a sequence of static images. While this approach democratized comic creation, it locked content into a digital format that mirrors the limitations of print. This rigid structure makes simple edits cumbersome, turns translation into a slow and expensive manual effort, and prevents the kind of rich, interactive experiences modern audiences expect.

## Why We're Building This

The Open Webtoon Format isn't just a theoretical exercise; it's our answer to the real-world frustrations we faced building our own platform. We repeatedly confronted the inefficiencies of the static-image workflow and realized that the industry's foundation was holding back innovation. Instead of simply building on top of a flawed system, we decided to tackle the root of the problem and create an open, modern, and efficient standard for everyone.

## Project vs. Published Files

The **owt** ecosystem uses a professional two-file system, separating the creator's rich, editable project from the lightweight, optimized file meant for publication.

- **The Project File `.owtproj:`** The master source file for the creator. This is a complex, non-destructive container that holds every layer, every asset, and every piece of editable text for a single **chapter**.
- **The Published File `.owtpub`:** The file for the reader. This is a single, **packaged**, and highly-optimized file that is easy for web platforms and reader apps to parse and display efficiently.

## Key Benefits for Platforms & Translators

A standardized, dynamic format creates a better experience across the entire ecosystem. The translation process is radically simplifiedâ€”instead of manually editing hundreds of images, translators can work with a single text file. Platforms can leverage a unified standard to build innovative features, deliver content more efficiently, and serve a global audience with on-the-fly translations.

## Key Benefits for Readers

For the first time, webtoons can become truly accessible. Because text is no longer flattened into the artwork, it can be read aloud by screen readers, translated on the fly, or resized for comfort. This new foundation also enables interactive elements to enrich the story and allows for more efficient data packaging that can lead to faster load times.

## Specification (Work in Progress)

The full v1.0 specification for the `.owtproj` and `.owtpub` formats is currently under active development. The goal is to create a standard that is both powerful for creators and efficient for platforms. Community feedback during this phase is highly encouraged.
